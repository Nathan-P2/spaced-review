# Spaced Review

## This project aims to develop a platform for the 100 days of code challenge

Have you ever wondered if you are studying efficiently? The spaced review method is one of the best methods to study. It is proven that, if you have a routine of reviewing the content you have studied over time, it is unlikely that you will forget it.

This project therefore automatically creates spaced reviews for you via the ChatGPT API and reminds you to review them. Enjoy.
